# PBDAA-Fall-2022

PBDAA-Fall-2022 Course Project (GHG Emissions and Deforestation). This README outlines our project, data sources, code and visualizations. We note each of these sections below.

## Project

Please refer to the attached Project Proposal for details as to our project!

## Data Sources

Please refer to the attached Project Proposal for details as to our project!

## Code

For our project, we utilized Hadoop MapReduce for our initial data cleaning, where we then loaded our datasets into Hive. From Hive, we analyzed our data and wrote the results of our analysis into several output files, from which we created visualizations within Python. Our code is organized in the following directories. 

* `initial` - this directory contains our data sources and the initial code we used to clean our data set.
* `hive` - this directory contains the queries we used to load and process our data (hive_queries.sh)
* `viz` - this directory contains the Python code to create visualizations from the data

## Visualizations  

* Note that we used Python to generate our visualizations. You may find our code in `viz/main.py` and our diagrams in `viz/output`
